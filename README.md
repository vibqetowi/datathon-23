## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a trading algorithm that could operate within a specified historical period (2000-2015) with the goal of optimizing ROI. The strategy was constrained to include 80-120 stocks from a pre-selected pool of 304 S&P 500 stocks, rebalance daily, and avoid the use of future information.

An innovative approach was taken by leveraging the correlation between industry performance and the S&P 500 index's daily movements. The algorithm was designed to prefer industries with a higher correlation on green days and a lower correlation on red days.

## Industry Correlation Analysis
The industry_correlations script was developed to calculate the daily percentage return for each industry and the S&P 500, separate the returns into green and red days based on the S&P 500's performance, and calculate the correlation coefficients for each scenario.

Here is a breakdown of the script's functionality:

Data Import: Industry data is imported and timestamped for accurate analysis.
Return Calculation: Daily returns are computed for both the industry and S&P 500.
Day Classification: Days are classified as green or red based on S&P 500 performance.
Correlation Calculation: Correlation coefficients for green and red days are calculated and stored.
Industry Selection: Industries are selected based on the linear regression model fitting green-day correlation against red-day correlation, prioritizing those with the highest green-day correlation and furthest below the linear fit.
What Was Envisioned But Not Implemented
LSTM Model
The plan was to incorporate a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to take into account the industry discriminations when making predictions. This would have potentially added a more refined and predictive aspect to the trading algorithm.

## Cumulative Performance
A cumulative percent performance was calculated for individual S&P stocks versus the S&P 500 index, with the intent to inform stock selection through a moving average crossover strategy.

## What Went Wrong
# RNN Integration Issues
The project encountered challenges with the integration of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly due to a knowledge gap that made the implementation unfeasible within the constraints and timeframe of the challenge.

# Technical Hurdles
There were difficulties in optimizing for alpha, accounting for trading fees, and adhering to the fundamental constraints set out by the challenge. This resulted in the project not reaching its full potential technically.

# Learning Outcomes
Despite the setbacks, this project served as an important educational journey, providing insight into portfolio management and machine learning.
# About
This repository is Team 23's submission for the polyfinance datathon 
The team is comprised of 3 people, two have traded a bit but not using quant strategies and none of us have done ML
## Assumptions

start value of Portfolio is 1M (given by the polyfinance team)
the goal is trying to beat the S&P over 2000-2015

## Structure of the project:
- Our Working Code files are in the work_files folder
- online_tutorials folder contains things we tried as we leartn the basics following tutorials
- model_save contains out exported models, it was easier to work with then ecporting model weights so we do apologize
- the kaggle folder does contain additional public data that we either generated by splitting the current dataset or through public sources like yfinance

## Stock Prediction
The work can be found in stock_prediiction.ipynb

Basically the thought was that we dont really care about closing prce just the percentage return. if we can accurately predict percentage moves, we can predict and buy the overperdormers and sell the underperformers in any period

the model chosen was LSTM mostly because the first page pof google said rnn's are good at time series data and the tutorial on youtube was followable. The decision of the archite4cture was completely arbitrary, we inteded to just iterate thenumbers of layers until we got the best perfermor but just didnt have time to doso

the approach to the feature selection was trhe kitchen sink approach, we just put every single indicator from the workshops as well as random blogs and then tried to algorithmically do the feature engineering . Doing it manually was challenging because when we tried looking at varaince and correlation, there was basically no correlation between the values of today and the return value of tomorrow and after days the mse never got below 0.0025 which sounds good in 
## Weights

Alpha score matters a lot

As constraints are added, alpha score diminishes
Constraints are necessary for diversification
While alpha score might decrease, Active Risk will decrease. Goal: 3-4%

Alpha Score | Stock Weight Index | Constraints XYZ > Portfolio Weight 

Possible Constraints :
- Industry
- Country
- Carbon Footprint
