# About
This repository is Team 23's submission for the polyfinance datathon 
The team is comprised of 3 people, two have traded a bit but not using quant strategies and none of us have done ML
## Assumptions

start value of Portfolio is 1M (given by the polyfinance team)
the goal is trying to beat the S&P over 2000-2015

## Structure of the project:
- Our Working Code files are in the work_files folder
- online_tutorials folder contains things we tried as we leartn the basics following tutorials
- model_save contains out exported models, it was easier to work with then ecporting model weights so we do apologize
- the kaggle folder does contain additional public data that we either generated by splitting the current dataset or through public sources like yfinance

## Stock Prediction
The work can be found in stock_prediiction.ipynb

Basically the thought was that we dont really care about closing prce just the percentage return. if we can accurately predict percentage moves, we can predict and buy the overperdormers and sell the underperformers in any period

the model chosen was LSTM mostly because the first page pof google said rnn's are good at time series data and the tutorial on youtube was followable. The decision of the archite4cture was completely arbitrary, we inteded to just iterate thenumbers of layers until we got the best perfermor but just didnt have time to doso

the approach to the feature selection was trhe kitchen sink approach, we just put every single indicator from the workshops as well as random blogs and then tried to algorithmically do the feature engineering . Doing it manually was challenging because when we tried looking at varaince and correlation, there was basically no correlation between the values of today and the return value of tomorrow and after days the mse never got below 0.0025 which sounds good in 
## Weights

Alpha score matters a lot

As constraints are added, alpha score diminishes
Constraints are necessary for diversification
While alpha score might decrease, Active Risk will decrease. Goal: 3-4%

Alpha Score | Stock Weight Index | Constraints XYZ > Portfolio Weight 

Possible Constraints :
- Industry
- Country
- Carbon Footprint
